characteristics and fleet_archive are not used in this test but need to be in the file location so characteristics is just the original official table, 
fleet_archive is the manufactured input used in advanced clean (small size compared to original and contents irrelevant).

index_fleet is a small carefully manufactored dataframe for testing purposes.
