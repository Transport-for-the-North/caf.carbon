# Fleet Emissions Model (CAFCarb)
The FEM is a tool to estimate current and future carbon emissions from surface transport in the North. 
It takes vehicle-km demand data from TfN and other regional transport models and combines it with other input datasets from DfT and the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI), along with TfN scenarios for new vehicle sales, to produce projections of CO2 emissions into the future.
