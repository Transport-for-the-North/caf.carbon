"""The main elements of the CAFCarb tool are:

-	VKM distribution tool, which distributes vehicle kilometres from a Saturn network to a zonal assignment,
-	Fleet emissions model, based on TfN’s NoCarb,
-	VKM emissions model, yet unbuilt, as an alternative form of emissions calculation, that competes with NoCarb in alternating utility,
-	an inbuilt assurance and comparison module of the two emissions models,
-	the supporting emissions tools, such as rail, bus and freight emissions.
